# scm_decryption_rule (Data Source)

DecryptionRule data source

## Example Usage

```terraform
# We use the ID from the resource created above.
data "scm_decryption_rule" "single_rule_by_id" {
  # Requires the unique UUID of the rule
  id = "b3544acb-fc55-4c6f-921d-4128b5a1d135"
}

output "single_decryption_rule_name" {
  description = "The name of the single rule fetched by ID."
  value       = data.scm_decryption_rule.single_rule_by_id
}
```
