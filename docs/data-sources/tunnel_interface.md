}

# Output various attributes from the found tunnel interface to verify the lookups were successful.
output "scm_tunnel_interface_data_source_results" {
  description = "The details of the tunnel interface read from the data source"
  value = {
    id      = data.scm_tunnel_interface.scm_tunnel_intf_ds.id
    name    = data.scm_tunnel_interface.scm_tunnel_intf_ds.name
