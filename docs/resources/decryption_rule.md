# scm_decryption_rule (Resource)

DecryptionRule resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
# --- 1. TAG Resource ---
resource "scm_tag" "decryption_position_tag" {
  name   = "decryption-position-tag"
  folder = "All"
  color  = "Purple"
}

# --- 2. ANCHOR DECRYPTION RULE (Used for relative positioning) ---
resource "scm_decryption_rule" "anchor_decryption_rule" {
  name        = "anchor-decryption-rule"
  description = "Base rule for testing 'before' and 'after' positioning."
  folder      = "All"
  position    = "pre" # Decryption Rules typically exist in the 'pre' rulebase
  action      = "decrypt"

  # Core Match Criteria (REQUIRED fields)
  from        = ["trust"]         # Source security zone

  service     = ["service-https"] # Services (e.g., standard HTTPS port)
